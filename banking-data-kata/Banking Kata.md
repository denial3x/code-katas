## Your Task

Your bank is tired of its mainframe COBOL accounting software and they hired both of you for a greenfield project in - what a happy coincidence

-   your favorite programming language!

Your task is to show them that your TDD-fu and your new-age programming language can cope with good oleâ€™ COBOL!

## Requirements

Write a class `Account` that offers the following methods void deposit(int) void withdraw(int) String printStatement()

An example statement would be:

```
Date        Amount  Balance
24.12.2015   +500      500
23.8.2016    -100      400
```
